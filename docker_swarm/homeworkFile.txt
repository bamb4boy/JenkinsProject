1- Create 2 AWS instances (Free tier)
2- SSH into the the first server 
3- Install Docker 
4- Create a compose file (nginx)
5- Create a swarm cluster

docker swarm init 

(Copy and save the docker swarm join command )

6- Deploy a new stack:

docker stack deploy mystack -c docker-compose.yml

7- SSH into the second AWS node, using the saved command from step 5

* It should look line this:

docker swarm join --token SWMTKN-1-1u51hprrpipidvazj6cgugodopzk1e9q3fsbi2yznsbo6y0x6q-5uawtff0s5z57ioj4g4tfhxn3 10.110.111.73:2377

* List your cluster nodes and verify all is OK:

docker node ls

8- list your services:

docker service ls

9- Scale the services to 10 container:

docker service scale <your_service>=10

10- list your services and make sure they are running on both cluster nodes

docker service ls
